## Exercise to try linting and styling in R

This is a small exercise to try out linting and styling in R. It uses the `styler` package to re-style code and the `lintr` package to lint code.

-   `exercises.R` -- This script installs requirements and has the exercise instructions. Open this file in R Studio and run the code to install the packages. You can then run the exercises in the console or in a new script.

-   `supplementary_tables_excel*` -- These scripts are taken from a [project I've been working on with Mark](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/antidep-gwas). You are welcome to open them and have a go at re-styling my code. You may find it easier to [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) if you're using my scripts.
