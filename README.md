## Coding Club Materials for Code Styling and linting

Materials adapted from [The Turing Way](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way). I made quarto markdown slides from the materials on the [Code Styling chapter](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/code-styling).

**Slides are hosted on GitHub pages [here](https://ccbs-stradl.github.io/coding_club_linting/coding_club_linting.html#/title-slide)**

Follow the exercises to have a go at using lintr and stylr in `exercise/exercises.R`. Answers are on the "linter" branch.
